Overview

I created a Netflix clone project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a fully functional and responsive web application that mimics the core features of Netflix. 

Features

Responsive Design:

The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
I utilized CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styles based on the screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices.

Interactive Elements:

The navigation bar allows users to explore different sections, such as Home, TV Shows, Movies, and My List.
A search functionality enables users to quickly find specific titles.
The carousel feature allows users to scroll through media items horizontally, providing an engaging browsing experience.

Content Display:

Clicking on a media item opens a detailed view with information such as the title, description, rating, and a "Play" button.
The "Play" button simulates the playback of the selected media, giving users a feel of streaming content.

JavaScript Functionality:

I used JavaScript to handle dynamic content loading and interactivity.
The carousel functionality was implemented using JavaScript, allowing smooth scrolling through media items.
JavaScript was also used to manage the search functionality and to dynamically update the content displayed on the page.

Styling with CSS:

Custom CSS was used to style all elements, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.
Flexbox and Grid layouts were employed to create a flexible and adaptive layout.
Transitions and animations were added to enhance the user experience, making interactions feel smooth and responsive.

Challenges and Solutions

Ensuring Responsiveness: One of the primary challenges was making sure the design remained consistent across different screen sizes. This was addressed by extensive use of media queries and testing on various devices.
Dynamic Content Management: Handling dynamic content loading and updates required efficient use of JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques.

Conclusion

This Netflix clone project demonstrates my ability to create a fully functional and responsive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It highlights my skills in web design, front-end development, and user experience optimization. The project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply and enhance my knowledge of modern web development practices.
